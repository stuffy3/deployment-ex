          There is no magic in Alluvion. Alluvion, a land ruled by the High King
          Viran, has not felt the presence of magic in centuries. Certainly for
          the starved and bedraggled prisoner Destin, the idea that magic might
          somehow be able to deliver him from the horrors of slavery is a
          fantasy indeed. He carries with him a terrible and deadly secret, for
          he possesses a spark of those who were once hailed as the sole
          protectors of Alluvion, the Highborn: people capable of wielding
          powerful magic. Though the Highborn kept the peace for hundreds of
          years, their reign came to an abrupt end and they vanished, never to
          be seen again. Destin may be the key that will unlock the door to this
          mystery, but struggles to cultivate his powers; he knows if he is
          discovered the penalty will surely be a painful death. Despite all
          this, Destin knows the secret that will utterly shatter the fabric of
          their world: There is magic in Alluvion.

          T.J. Stufflebeam dove into his first fantasy novel when he was eight
          years old-- Redwall. Years later, the Hobbit, Eragon, and the rest of
          the Redwall series were avidly read. Harnessing the power of his
          library card, he grabbed as many fantasy and adventure books that he
          could find. With a vivid imagination, T.J. was caught by teachers and
          parents daydreaming on a regular basis. In his 20s, his best friend
          asked him to try out for a play Dracula the Musical. This lead to him
          performing in multiple dramas, musicals, and diving into improv more.
          His father discovered T.J.'s love for storytelling, helping to guide
          T.J. to developing his talent more. When he was 26, T.J sat down and
          started to work on his first full-length book with the goal of
          publishing. Two years later he held Legacy of the Highborn in his
          hands. T.J. is a part of the Tiktok author community uploading author
          tips and tricks with the occasional normal life video. Outside of
          storytelling, T.J. can be found playing tabletop games, competing in
          Virtual Reality, and playing club soccer. Occasionally you'll find him
          at a Con either in his Spider-Man or Power Rangers Cosplay. He's
          tackled several Role Playing Game campaigns narrowly escaping with his
          character's life. So, really, he can fly his nerd flag with pretty
          much anyone, and frequently does. Settled in Orem, Utah near his
          family. T.J works in Cyber Security in helping victims of Identity
          Theft. With no spouse, pets, T.J. mainly spends his nights writing
          into the dark of the night.
